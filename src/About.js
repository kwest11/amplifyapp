      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am MountyKoder, and this is my little corner of the internet where I aggregate various feeds of information that interest me.</p>

      <p>Behind the scenes, I curate content from different sources to create a personalized experience. While most of the website is protected behind a username and password, I have decided to share this about page to give you a glimpse into who I am and what you can expect to find here.</p>

      <p>I am passionate about West Virginia, skiing, and running. This website reflects my ongoing exploration of these subjects. Feel free to explore and get a sense of what makes this space uniquely mine.</p>
